Demo web browser crypto test

This uses Webcrypto API to generate "cryptokens" in the browser.  The purpose is to demonstrate the capability to cyrptographically tokenise (or cryptokenise) sensitive fields so they are not accessible beyond the browser, and only recoverable once returned to the browser.
